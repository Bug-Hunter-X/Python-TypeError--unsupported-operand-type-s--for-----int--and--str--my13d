This repository demonstrates a common Python error: a TypeError resulting from an attempt to perform an operation (in this case, addition) on incompatible data types.  The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.py` file shows how to resolve this by using type checking or converting the types to be compatible before performing the operation. This is a fundamental error to understand for robust Python programming.
